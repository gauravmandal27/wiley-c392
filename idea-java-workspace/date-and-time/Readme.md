## Dates, Numbers, and Currency:

Java provides classes to work with dates, numbers, and currencies:

- `java.util.Date` for representing dates and times.
- `java.util.Calendar` for date manipulation.
- `java.util.NumberFormat` for formatting numbers.
- `java.util.Currency` for representing currencies.

### Working with Dates, Numbers, and Currencies:

Java's `java.util.Date` class represents a specific instant in time, while `java.util.Calendar` provides more functionality for date manipulation, such as adding or subtracting days, months, or years.

### Parsing, Tokenizing, and Formatting:

Java provides classes such as `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` for parsing and formatting dates, `java.util.StringTokenizer` for tokenizing strings, and `java.util.Formatter` for general-purpose formatting.
