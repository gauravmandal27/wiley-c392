1. Given a collection of strings, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) such that the concatenation of the two strings at those indices forms a palindrome.
2. Given a collection of non-negative integers, form the largest number possible by concatenating the integers together. For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number would be 9534330.
3. Find the longest consecutive sequence of elements in a collection. For example, in the collection [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
4. Create a function that checks whether one collection is a subset of another collection.
5. Write a function that takes in a list or array and returns a new collection containing only the unique elements from the original collection.
