1. #### File Navigation and I/O:


#### Input/Output (I/O):

Input/Output (I/O) in Java involves reading from and writing to streams of data. Streams represent sequences of data, either bytes or characters, that can be read from or written to.

### 2. Types of Streams:

#### Byte Streams:

Byte streams handle I/O of raw binary data. They are used for reading and writing byte-oriented data. Examples include `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`.

#### Character Streams:

Character streams handle I/O of character data, automatically handling the encoding and decoding of characters. They are used for reading and writing text files. Examples include `FileReader` and `FileWriter`.

### 3. The Byte-stream I/O Hierarchy:

The Byte-stream I/O hierarchy includes classes that are used for handling byte-oriented I/O operations. Some key classes in this hierarchy are:

- `InputStream`: Abstract class representing input stream of bytes.
- `OutputStream`: Abstract class representing output stream of bytes.
- `FileInputStream`: Used to read data from a file as a stream of bytes.
- `FileOutputStream`: Used to write data into a file as a stream of bytes.

### 4. Character Stream Hierarchy:

The Character Stream hierarchy includes classes used for handling character-oriented I/O operations. Some key classes in this hierarchy are:

- `Reader`: Abstract class representing character input stream.
- `Writer`: Abstract class representing character output stream.
- `FileReader`: Used to read characters from a file.
- `FileWriter`: Used to write characters to a file.

### 5. `RandomAccessFile` class:

The `RandomAccessFile` class allows both reading and writing to a file. It supports random access, meaning you can move to any position in the file to read or write data.

### 6. The `java.io.Console` Class:

The `java.io.Console` class provides methods for reading input from the console and writing text to the console.

### 7. Serialization:

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store it in a file or send it over a network. Java provides built-in serialization support through the `java.io.Serializable` interface and the `ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream` classes.

### 8. Locating Data via Pattern Matching:

Java's `java.util.regex` package provides support for regular expressions, which can be used for pattern matching in strings.

### 9. Tokenizing:

Tokenizing involves splitting a string into smaller parts called tokens. Java's `java.util.StringTokenizer` class can be used for tokenizing strings based on delimiters.
